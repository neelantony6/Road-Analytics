# Road Safety Analytics Platform - My Video Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm excited to showcase my Road Safety Analytics Platform that I built using JavaScript and React. In this video, I'll walk you through how I implemented various features and show you the JavaScript code behind them."

## Part 1: Project Overview (45 seconds)
"Let me show you the main parts of my application:
1. A data collection system with form validation
2. An analytics dashboard with interactive visualizations
3. Real-time data synchronization using Firebase"

## Part 2: Data Collection System [AR2] (2 minutes)

### Form Implementation
"One of the interesting challenges I tackled was implementing a form that handles three different data types. Here's how I did it using JavaScript:"

1. String Fields:
   ```javascript
   // From submit-report.jsx - My custom validation rules
   const accidentReportSchema = z.object({
     location: z.string()
       .min(3, "Please enter a more specific location")
       .max(100, "Location description is too long"),
     description: z.string()
       .min(20, "Could you provide more details?")
       .max(500, "Description is too long")
   });
   ```

2. Number Fields:
   ```javascript
   // My numeric validation with custom error messages
   vehiclesInvolved: z.number()
     .int()
     .min(1, "At least one vehicle must be involved")
     .max(10, "For major incidents, contact emergency services"),
   injuryCount: z.number()
     .int()
     .min(0, "Number of injuries cannot be negative")
   ```

3. Boolean Fields:
   ```javascript
   // Critical flags for emergency response
   medicalAssistance: z.boolean().default(false),
   hitAndRun: z.boolean().default(false)
   ```

## Part 3: Form Handling and Real-time Updates (1.5 minutes)

"Here's how I handle form submission and real-time updates:"

1. Form Configuration:
   ```javascript
   // My form setup for handling user input
   const accidentForm = useForm({
     resolver: zodResolver(accidentReportSchema),
     defaultValues: {
       vehiclesInvolved: 1,
       injuryCount: 0,
       medicalAssistance: false,
       hitAndRun: false,
     },
   });
   ```

2. Real-time Data Handling:
   ```javascript
   // My real-time data fetching implementation
   const { data: submittedReports = [] } = useQuery({
     queryKey: ['accidentReports'],
     queryFn: firebaseService.getAccidentReports
   });

   // My mutation setup for form submissions
   const accidentMutation = useMutation({
     mutationFn: firebaseService.submitAccidentReport,
     onSuccess: () => {
       toast({
         title: "Report Submitted",
         description: "Successfully submitted.",
       });
       accidentForm.reset();
     }
   });
   ```

## Part 4: Analytics Dashboard [AR3] (2 minutes)

"For the analytics part, I wrote several JavaScript functions to process and visualize the data:"

1. Data Analysis Functions:
   ```javascript
   // My custom analysis function to calculate trends
   function calculateTrends(data) {
     const states = Object.keys(data.yearly_data);
     const years = ["2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"];

     // Calculate overall trend
     const totalsByYear = years.map(year =>
       states.reduce((sum, state) => 
         sum + data.yearly_data[state][year], 0)
     );

     const overallChange = ((totalsByYear[3] - totalsByYear[0]) / 
       totalsByYear[0] * 100).toFixed(1);
   }
   ```

2. Data Processing Functions:
   ```javascript
   // My helper functions for data analysis
   const getAverageInjuries = () => {
     if (submittedReports.length === 0) return 0;
     const total = submittedReports.reduce((sum, report) => 
       sum + report.injuryCount, 0);
     return (total / submittedReports.length).toFixed(1);
   };
   ```

## Part 5: Key Technical Decisions (1 minute)

"Let me highlight some key technical decisions I made:
1. Used modern JavaScript features for better code organization
2. Implemented Zod for robust form validation
3. Chose React Query for efficient data management
4. Used Recharts for responsive data visualization"

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Modern JavaScript development
- React hooks and components
- Data validation and form handling
- Real-time data management
- Analytics and data visualization

Thank you for watching!"

## Key Points to Emphasize:
1. Multiple data type handling in forms
2. Custom validation with JavaScript
3. Real-time updates with React Query
4. Interactive data visualization with Recharts
5. Modern JavaScript features and best practices
