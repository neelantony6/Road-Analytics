📌 Coursework Brief: Road Traffic Accidents Data Visualization Website
🎯 Objective
Develop a web-based information system to provide the public with insights into road traffic accidents using interactive data visualizations. The system will fetch accident data from a Firebase Realtime Database and display it dynamically on a website hosted via Replit.

1️⃣ Project Components
🔹 Data Collection & Storage
The dataset consists of road traffic accident statistics (e.g., total accidents, fatalities, trends).
Data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database in JSON format.
Python was used to clean and upload the dataset to Firebase.
🔹 Data Visualizations (Using Plotly)
Two interactive graphs have been generated with Plotly:

Graph 1: Accident Trends Over Time (Line chart)
Graph 2: State-wise Comparison (Bar chart)
These graphs are saved as SVG and HTML files to be displayed on the website.
2️⃣ Website Requirements
🔹 Core Features
✅ Fetch data from Firebase and display in a readable format.
✅ Embed Plotly visualizations (interactive charts).
✅ Responsive web design to work on desktops & mobile devices.
✅ User-friendly interface with a clean layout.
✅ Simple navigation for accessing different visualizations.

🔹 Tech Stack
📌 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
📌 Backend: Firebase (Realtime Database)
📌 Hosting: Replit

3️⃣ Firebase Database Structure
The data in Firebase is stored in JSON format like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "accident_data": {
    "Maharashtra": { "total_accidents": 15234, "fatal_accidents": 3400 },
    "Delhi": { "total_accidents": 12000, "fatal_accidents": 2800 },
    "Tamil Nadu": { "total_accidents": 18050, "fatal_accidents": 4000 }
  }
}
4️⃣ Website Implementation Steps
✅ Step 1: Set Up Firebase in Replit
Add Firebase SDK to the project.
Connect to Firebase Realtime Database.
Fetch accident data and display it dynamically.
✅ Step 2: Display Interactive Graphs
Load the SVG/HTML versions of Plotly graphs.
Use JavaScript to make them interactive.
✅ Step 3: Improve UI/UX
Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.
Include a search/filter feature for specific states/years.
5️⃣ Deliverables
✅ Web-based Information System (hosted on Replit)
✅ Interactive Graphs (Plotly-based visualizations)
✅ Firebase Integration (Realtime Data Fetching)
✅ Well-structured Code (HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase SDK)

6️⃣ Next Steps
Ask Replit AI to generate the website based on this brief.
Test Firebase connectivity and ensure data loads properly.
Embed the Plotly visualizations into the webpage.
📌 Summary
This project is a data-driven web application that provides public insights into road traffic accidents through interactive visualizations, using Firebase as a backend and Replit for hosting.
